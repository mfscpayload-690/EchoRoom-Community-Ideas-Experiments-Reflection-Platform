# EchoRoom 🌱
**Community Ideas, Experiments & Reflection Platform**

EchoRoom is an open-source platform where communities share ideas, run small
experiments, document outcomes, and reflect on what they learn — openly and
collaboratively.

Unlike typical idea platforms, EchoRoom focuses on **learning loops**, not just
discussion or voting.

This project is part of **Open Source Quest (OSQ)** and is designed to support
contributors from diverse skill backgrounds.

## 🧠 Core Idea

Every idea in EchoRoom follows a simple loop:\
*Idea → Experiment → Outcome → Reflection → Shared Learning*

The goal is not to “win” ideas, but to **learn from trying them**.

---

## 🎯 Why EchoRoom?

Communities often:
- Share ideas without follow-up
- Forget why decisions were made
- Learn little from failed attempts

EchoRoom helps communities:
- Turn ideas into experiments
- Record what actually happened
- Reflect on successes and failures
- Build shared knowledge over time

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 💡 Idea submission & discussion
- 🧪 Experiment tracking (time-bound trials)
- 📊 Outcome recording (success / failure / mixed)
- 🧠 Reflection & learning notes
- 🏷️ Tags & categories
- 📖 Public knowledge archive
