# Moderation Guidelines for EchoRoom

## Purpose

EchoRoom is about trying things openly and learning from what happens — even when it doesn’t go well.

These guidelines help keep experiments and reflections safe, respectful, and focused on real growth.

---

## Core Principles

### 1) Psychological Safety First

Experiments often fail. EchoRoom treats failure as learning.

Content should:
- Encourage honest reflection without fear of judgment
- Treat setbacks as data, not personal shortcomings
- Support experimentation without shame

### 2) Respect & Inclusion

Everyone deserves dignity and fairness.

Content must:
- Use inclusive, non-discriminatory language
- Avoid stereotypes and harmful generalizations
- Welcome diverse perspectives and backgrounds

### 3) Constructive Sharing

Failures are valuable when shared thoughtfully.

Reflections should:
- Focus on what was learned, not blame
- Provide enough context to understand outcomes
- Help others avoid similar pitfalls

### 4) Learning Loop First

Support the full **Idea → Experiment → Outcome → Reflection** cycle without fear or embarrassment.

---

## Language Guidelines

### ✅ Respectful Language
Use:
- A clear, professional tone
- Person-first language when appropriate
- Neutral descriptors
- “We tried…” instead of “I failed…”

Example:
> “Our experiment to increase engagement didn’t achieve the target metrics. We learned that sending notifications during work hours reduced click-through rates by 40%.”

### ❌ Disrespectful Language
Avoid:
- Personal attacks or name-calling
- Derogatory terms or slurs
- Sarcasm that undermines others
- Blaming individuals for experiment failures
- Gendered, ableist, or culturally insensitive language

Example (What NOT to do):
> ❌ “This stupid idea failed because John didn’t know what he was doing.”

---

## Handling Sensitive Topics

### When Experiments Touch Sensitive Areas
Experiments may involve:
- Mental health and wellbeing
- Financial decisions or hardship
- Health conditions or medical topics
- Political or social issues
- Cultural or religious practices

Guidelines:

#### Add Content Warnings when needed
Example:
> `[CW: Discussion of anxiety in workplace experiments]`

#### Avoid Overgeneralization
- ❌ “All remote workers struggle with isolation”
- ✅ “In our 3-month trial, 60% of participants reported feeling isolated”

#### Respect Privacy
- Anonymize participant data
- Don’t share identifiable details without consent
- Use aggregated results when possible

#### Acknowledge Limitations
- Small sample sizes don’t represent everyone
- Context matters (what worked here may not work elsewhere)

---

## Topics Requiring Extra Care

### Mental Health
- Don’t diagnose or give medical advice
- Share experiences, not prescriptions
- Include resources where appropriate (helplines, professional support)

### Financial Experiments
- Clearly state this is not financial advice
- Acknowledge different circumstances
- Avoid promoting specific products/services

### Workplace / Power Dynamics
- Be mindful of hierarchy and consent
- Avoid experiments that exploit vulnerable positions
- Protect participant anonymity

---

## Sharing Failures Constructively

### The EchoRoom Failure Framework
Failed experiments are learning goldmines. Use this structure:

#### 1) Context
- Original hypothesis
- Why you thought it would work
- What success looked like

#### 2) What Happened
- Timeline of events
- Data or metrics observed
- Unexpected results

#### 3) What We Learned
- Assumptions that were wrong
- Variables you didn’t consider
- What surprised you

#### 4) What We’d Do Differently
- What to change next time
- What to try instead
- Questions raised for future experiments

#### 5) How Others Can Use This
- Who else might face this?
- What contexts does this apply to?
- What should others watch out for?

#### Tone Tip
- Keep it humble: **“This didn’t work for us”** instead of **“This never works.”**

---

## Example: Good vs. Poor Failure Reflections

### ❌ Poor Reflection
> “We tried to improve team morale with a pizza party. It failed. Nobody showed up. Don’t do pizza parties.”

Problems:
- No context or data
- Blames the idea without analysis
- No useful takeaways

### ✅ Good Reflection
**Experiment:** Monthly team pizza lunch to improve morale  
**Context:** Remote team of 12 across 4 time zones. Engagement was declining in team channels.  
**What Happened:** Scheduled for 12pm EST. Only 3 people attended (25%). A follow-up survey showed the time conflicted with 7 people’s schedules.  

**What We Learned:**
- Synchronous events exclude distributed teams
- “One-size-fits-all” morale boosters don’t work remotely
- We assumed availability without checking

**What We’d Do Differently:**
- Survey availability first
- Consider async alternatives (monthly stipend, self-chosen activities)
- Test different time slots with smaller groups

**For Others:** If your team spans time zones, synchronous morale events may exclude more people than they include. Consider async or regionally-adapted approaches.

## Moderation Actions

### When Content Should Be Flagged

#### Immediate Moderation Required
- Hate speech or slurs
- Harassment or personal attacks
- Doxxing or privacy violations
- Spam or promotional content
- Illegal activity or dangerous advice

#### Review Required
- Potentially triggering content without warnings
- Accusations without evidence
- Overly promotional language
- Misleading claims or unsupported data

---

## How Moderation Works

### Community Flagging
- Members can flag content for review
- Moderators aim to review flags within 24–48 hours

### Moderator Actions
Moderators may:
- Request edits (most common)
- Add content warnings
- Lock discussions
- Archive content (for serious violations)
- Contact authors for clarification

### Appeals Process
- Authors can appeal moderation decisions
- Admins review appeals
- Decisions should be explained transparently

---

## Content Warning Examples
Use when content discusses:
- `[CW: Mental health]`
- `[CW: Financial loss]`
- `[CW: Workplace conflict]`
- `[CW: Health conditions]`
- `[CW: Detailed failure analysis with personal impact]`

---

## Encouraged Behaviors

### What Makes a Great Reflection?
✅ Vulnerability with boundaries  
Share what went wrong without oversharing private details.

✅ Data over emotions  
“Engagement dropped 40%” vs. “Everyone hated it.”

✅ Specific, not vague  
“We tested A or B variants for 2 weeks” vs. “We tried some stuff.”

✅ Generous interpretation  
Assume good intent and ask questions before criticizing.

✅ Actionable insights  
“Try X instead of Y” vs. “This doesn’t work.”

---

## Red Flags for Moderators
Watch for patterns of:
- Repeatedly blaming individuals
- Dismissing experiments without evidence
- Promoting products or services
- Overgeneralizing from small samples
- Harsh criticism that discourages experimentation

---

## Community Norms

### We Value
- Honest reflection over perfectionism
- Learning over winning
- Questions over assumptions
- Iteration over abandonment

### We Discourage
- Shaming failed experiments
- Claiming universal truths from limited data
- Dismissing concerns about bias or harm
- Rushing to judgment

---

## Special Cases

### Experiments Involving People
- Obtain informed consent
- Explain how data will be used
- Participants can leave or stop the experiment whenever they want, without any consequences.
- Protect participant identities

### Commercial or Funded Experiments
- Disclose funding sources
- Clarify conflicts of interest
- Separate sponsored content from community experiments

### Abandoned Experiments
- Mark as “Paused” or “Discontinued” instead of deleting
- Share why it was stopped (valuable learning)
- Leave room for others to continue

---

## Resources for Contributors

### Before Submitting an Experiment
- Have I considered potential harms?
- Is my language respectful and inclusive?
- Have I protected participant privacy?
- Are my claims supported by data?
- Would I want someone to share about me this way?

### When Reflecting on Failure
- Did I provide enough context?
- Am I blaming systems/processes, not people?
- Can others learn something actionable from this?
- Have I added necessary content warnings?
